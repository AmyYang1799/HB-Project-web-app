# Recipe Lab

Recipe Lab is a web application that allows users to create personal recipes. Users are also able to save any recipe in the database as a favorite. ![Recipe Lab View Recipes Page](/static/images/recipe_lab_view_recipes.png)

The goal of Recipe Lab was to create a web application that family and friends can use to share recipes. Amy Yang is passionate about connecting with people through food and recipes. Amy plans to continue working on this web application to enable an  edit, delete, and search feature. She also hopes to add a SMS feature(using Twilio API) that sends a text to users about the ingredients for a recipe.
